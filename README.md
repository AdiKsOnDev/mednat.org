Group CourseWork for Web Design

This is an improved version of the actual "mednat.org"'s design 

------------------

# 📁💤Brief intro to the files' hierarchy 

'Assets' folder contains every image used in html\css files

You can add any Scripts that are meant to be reused (Or just the Scripts that are too big to be readable in an html file) to the 'Scripts' folder

Every html\css files are located in the directory named 'Alpha'

'reset.css' is a file that replaces EVERY default values for almost every css selector and should not be changed
